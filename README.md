# Stage 2: Trailers, Reviews, and Favorites

Add more information to your movie details view:

Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
Also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
